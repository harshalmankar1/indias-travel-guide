        <p class="p info ">India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich
            cultural
            heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence.
            India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized
            countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the
            benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan
            heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands
            apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct
            geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic
            of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the
            west. As you travel, India offers a range of vast tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people,
            tribes, cuisine, faiths, dance forms, music, arts, crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality, history; even
            these vary as you journey from one state to another. As a country, India has achieved all-round
            socio-economic progress in the last 70 years of independence. The change is clearly visible in the Tier I
            and Tier II cities. However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark difference as you travel through the
            new and old parts of its cities. From world-class airports and hotels, luxurious shopping malls,
            restaurants, pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities, filled with thousands
            of little shops offering every possible modern and ethnic product and native street food is a fascinating
            experience.</p>

        <h1 class="text-info">Ancient History</h1><br>
        India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization. It begins with
        a mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming communities in the southern lands of India. The
        history of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating people with the diverse cultures that
        surround India. Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals was widely
        prevalent in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of the progress that
        this part of the world had made. By the end of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of
        highly developed civilization. <br>


        <br>
        <h1 class="text-info">The Indus Valley Civilization</h1><br>
        The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization, more precisely known as
        Harappan Civilization. It flourished around 2,500 BC, in the western part of South Asia, what today is
        Pakistan and Western India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four ancient urban civilizations
        of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. Nothing was known about this civilization till 1920s when the
        Archaeological Department of India carried out excavations in the Indus valley wherein the ruins of the two
        old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were unearthed. The ruins of buildings and other things like
        household articles, weapons of war, gold and silver ornaments, seals, toys, pottery wares, etc., show that
        some four to five thousand years ago a highly developed Civilization flourished in this region.

        The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in well-planned and
        well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that
        these were magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well looked after. They had
        wide roads and a well-developed drainage system. The houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more
        storeys.

        The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted their
        staple food. They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well. Evidences also show
        that they wore cotton as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture came to an end. Among
        various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley Civilization are the recurrent floods and other natural
        causes like earthquake, etc.<br>


        <br>
        <h1 class="text-info">Vedic Civilization</h1><br>
        The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of ancient India. It is named after the
        Vedas, the early literature of the Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization flourished along the river
        Saraswati, in a region that now consists of the modern Indian states of Haryana and Punjab. Vedic is
        synonymous with Hinduism, which is another name for religious and spiritual thought that has evolved from
        the Vedas.

        The Ramayana and Mahabharata were the two great epics of this period.

                    <br>The name 'India' is derived from the River Indus, the valleys around which were the home of the

                    and 1568 respectively.<br>
